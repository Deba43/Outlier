## üîç Outlier Detection in Breast Cancer Data  
**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, [ELKI (Environment for Developing KDD-Applications Supported by Index-Structures)](https://elki-project.github.io/)

üß† Project Overview
This project focuses on anomaly detection in Breast Cancer data using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and High Contrast Subspaces (HICS) for effective subspace selection.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
‚úÖ LOF-based Anomaly Detection: Applied the LOF algorithm using KNN to detect anomalies in medical data.

‚úÖ High Contrast Subspace Selection: Implemented HICS to identify relevant subspaces for better feature contrast and anomaly identification.

‚úÖ Custom Feature Selection Methods:

selectHighContrastSubspaces

selectRandomFeatures

filterData

calculateContrast

‚úÖ Outlier Reporting: Identified and printed the top 10 outliers based on LOF scores.

‚úÖ Model Evaluation:

Evaluated results using a Confusion Matrix

Plotted the ROC curve and computed the AUC to measure detection performance.

This project demonstrates a practical application of subspace analysis and anomaly detection in medical datasets using Java and ELKI.
